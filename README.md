# Donation
There is a thing that can speed up the development of Blender addons for me. http://blendermarket.com/products/code-autocomplete/ So, if you want to help me out on getting this one, here is my PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/sergeishumakov2015. I will also share this purchased script with Miton who is at the moment working on a similar Blender plugin for .M2 models. So, by helping me, you can speed up the development of two tools at once.
