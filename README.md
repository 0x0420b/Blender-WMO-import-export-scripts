# Blender-WMO-import-export-scripts
Script addon for Blender featuring World of Warcraft World Model Object (WMO) import/export, aiming for making available full functionality supported by WMO format. 

# This is code is working progress
If you want to actually use the script now, you should obtain a stable release version from Model-Changing Netowrk. This repository is used for development, not for actual releases. If you want to help me out with improving the script, fixing bugs and solving problems, please make an issue. If you want to join the development, leave me a message.
